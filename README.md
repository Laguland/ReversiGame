# Visual Studio â€“ Reversi Game
This is one of the first university projects that I completed 4 years ago. It is based on reversi board game and it helped me to develop basic programming, AI design as well as AI algorithms implementation skills. Although I am not proud of design where the whole game is inside 3500 lines long class which make the project very hard to read. Game features:

 * AI that can play with both player or itself
 * Gameboard experience for two players.
